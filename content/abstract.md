## Abstract

Solid ecosystem and Solid Pods are of great interest as they promise to give application developers freedom of developing innovative applications and users the power of managing their own data. Many people are developing Solid applications which are creative and users can choose to use these applications depending on their needs. The interoperability between these applications is something which is unattended. In this demo, we show how two applications which are built differently are interoperable and how convinent it is for users to adapt to Solid ecosystem. These applications can create resources, update them, modify the data and also delete them. We will present a nice UI which does all the mentioned tasks and give users the freedom to be in control of their data.
