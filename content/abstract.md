## Abstract

Solid ecosystem and Solid Pods are of great interest as they promise to give developers freedom of developing innovative applications 
and users the power of storing their data anywhere on the web. 
Different applications built for performing same tasks are not interoperable with app data stored in the Pod.
In this demo, we show how two todo applications which are built using different frameworks are interoperable with the data in the Pod. 
These two todo applications share a same vocabulary and use WebId to authenticate themselves for creating resources, modifying the data and also deleting them.
These applications make use of link traversal with declarative SPARQL queries 
which relieve the app developers from being aware of where the data is stored in the decentralized Pod environment. 
We will present a UI which does all the mentioned tasks, store todo app data in the Solid Pod and give users the freedom to be in control of their data.
