## Abstract

Solid ecosystem and Solid Pods are of great interest as they promise to give developers freedom of developing innovative applications and users the power of storing their data anywhere on the web instead of giving complete control to the companies. Applications built around this idea need to access data from multiple user's Pods and the applications lack cross-Pod interoperability. In this demo, we show how two applications which are built using different frameworks are interoperable with the user's data. These two todo applications share the same vocabulary and use SPARQL to create resources, modify the data and also delete them. We will present a UI which does all the mentioned tasks and give users the freedom to be in control of their data.
