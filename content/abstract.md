## Abstract

Solid ecosystem and Solid Pods are of great interest as they promise to give developers freedom of developing innovative applications and users the power of managing their own data. Applications use different protocols to read, write and to access control the data in the user's pods. Even though the Solid ecosystem gives the freedom of decentralizing data from applications,  the Solid applications are not interoperable with the user's data. In this demo, we show how two applications which are built differently are interoperable with the user's data. These two todo applications share the same vocabulary and use SPARQL to create resources, modify the data and also delete them. We will present a UI which does all the mentioned tasks and give users the freedom to be in control of their data.
