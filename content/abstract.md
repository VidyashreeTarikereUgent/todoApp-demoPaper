## Abstract

Solid ecosystem and Solid Pods are of great interest as they promise to give users the freedom to choose where and how their data is stored on the Web. 
Different applications built for performing same tasks are not interoperable if they have different vocabularies.
In this demo, we show how two todo applications which are built using different frameworks are interoperable with the data in the Pod. 
These two todo applications share a same vocabulary and users use their WebIds to authenticate with the apps for creating resources, modifying the data and also deleting them.
These applications are query-driven applications and relieve app developers from being aware of where the data is stored in the decentralized Pod environment. 
We will present an UI which does all the mentioned tasks, store todo app data in the Solid Pod and give users the freedom to be in control of their data.
