## Abstract

Solid ecosystem and Solid Pods are of great interest as they promise to give developers freedom of developing innovative applications and users the power of managing their own data. The interoperability between these applications is something which is yet to be done in a meaningful way. In this demo, we show how two applications which are built differently are interoperable and how convinent it is for users to adapt to Solid ecosystem. These applications can create resources, update them, modify the data and also delete them. We will present a UI which does all the mentioned tasks and give users the freedom to be in control of their data.
