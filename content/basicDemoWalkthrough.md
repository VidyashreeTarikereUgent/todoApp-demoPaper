## Basic Demo Walkthrough

In our demonstration, we have developed two separate todo applications, available through the links, one built using the React framework and the other using Vue framework, both of which are available online. Interested person to try out the apps need to have a Solid Pod and an associated WebId to authenticate themselves in the applications. The applications then authenticates the person using Solid-OIDC and lets them to a nice application UI. Here, a person can enter the todos, which are then stored in the Solid Pods.

A person can create todos in React todo application and view, update or delete the todos in the Vue todo application and vice versa. These changes are reflected in the React todo application. Both the applications are using a single ontology which facilitates in the interoperability between them.
