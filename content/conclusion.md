## Conclusion

In this demo, we showed how various innovative applications can be built for Solid ecosystem using a similar ontology and querying with link traversal. This gives way to develop applications which are application-agnostic and motivates to develop creative applications. The source code of the two apps are publicly available in the github as mentioned in the links. 

As future work, we aim to use the same two todo applications with different ontologies.
