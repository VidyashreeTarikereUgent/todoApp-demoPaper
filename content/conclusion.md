## Conclusion

In this demo, we demonstrated how different interoperable applications can be built for the Solid ecosystem using the same ontology and a query-driven implementation.
The two apps must know the hardcoded write location to be interoperate.
The source code of [React-based app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-react){:.mandatory} and [Vue-based app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-vue){:.mandatory} are publicly available on GitHub.
In future work, we consider investigating more collaborative operations, such as assigning others to to-dos.
Furthermore, investigating schema alignment across apps using different ontologies is another important venue for future work.

<span class="comment" data-author="RV">The conclusion is too basic; it should be about how interop always requires a degree of prior agreement, but that Solid tries to minimize that. This demo already minimizes location-dependence for read (at what cost? mention), but future work is write-independence (suggestions for how?) and ontology-independence (how?).</span>
