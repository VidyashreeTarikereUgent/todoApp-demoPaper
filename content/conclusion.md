## Conclusion

In this demo, we demonstrated how different interoperable applications can be built for the Solid ecosystem using the same ontology and a query-driven implementation. 
The source code of [React app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-react){:.mandatory} and [Vue app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-vue){:.mandatory} are publicly available in the github. 

The two applications do not support collaboration with other Solid Pod users, which can be considered as future work.

Another avenue for future work is the usage of different ontologies to achieve interoperability.
This could be achieved through a schema alignment process.
