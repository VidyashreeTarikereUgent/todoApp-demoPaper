## Conclusion

In this demo, we demonstrated how different interoperable applications can be built for the Solid ecosystem using the same ontology and a query-driven implementation. The two apps must know the hardcoded write location to be interoperate.
The source code of [React-based app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-react){:.mandatory} and [Vue-ase app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-vue){:.mandatory} are publicly available on GitHub.
In future work, we consider investigating more collaborative operations, such as assigning others to Todo's.
Furthermore, investigating schema alignment across apps using different ontologies is another important venue for future work.
