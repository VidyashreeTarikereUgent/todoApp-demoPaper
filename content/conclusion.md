## Conclusion

In this demo, we showed how applications can be built for Solid ecosystem using the same ontology and query-driven implementation. 
The source code of [React app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-react){:.mandatory} and [Vue app](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/solid-todo-app-vue){:.mandatory} are publicly available in the github. 

The two applications do not support collaboration with other Solid Pod users, which can be considered as future work.
With schema alignment process, the applications can use different ontologies to be interoperable with the user data in the Solid Pods.
