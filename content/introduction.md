## Introduction and related work

In recent times there are many applications which are built on the basis of [Solid Protocol](cite:cites sambra2016solid). All these social Web applications focus on keeping users data decentralized from the application themselves and give users a great liberty to be in control of their own data and who has access to it and how it is used. Solid uses [Resource Description Framework(RDF)](cite:cites cyganiak2014rdf) and [Linked Data Platform(LDP)](cite:cites unknown) for its representation and operations in the Solid Pod. With linked data principles, data in the pod is interlinked with data in multiple pods. 

The RDF read and write operations in Solid is carried out with RESTful Web Application Interfaces(APIs). Since data in Solid Pods is represented in RDF, sparql queries can be used to query the pods. [Comunica-sparql](cite:cites taelman2018comunica) is a query engine which can be used for querying Solid Pods.

In this demonstration we are showcasing two todo apps which are developed with two different frameworks, [React todo app](https://solidlabresearch.github.io/solid-todo-app-react/){:.mandatory} and [Vue todo app](https://solidlabresearch.github.io/solid-todo-app-vue/){:.mandatory}, are interoperable in the Solid ecosystem. The two apps access a single user's pod by authorizing with the user's [WebID](cite:cites sambra2014webid). The todo applications can create new tasks, mark them as completed or pending, modify the tasks and also delete the tasks themselves in the user's pod.
