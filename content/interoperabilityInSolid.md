## Interoperability in Solid

Interoperibilty in Solid is the ability of multiple heterogenous Solid Pods and applications to work together to communicate with each other or to exchange data or to process data between among themselves.

Solid protocol uses different standards to help with interoperability. For the purpose of interoperability, Solid uses linked data and RDF. RDF helps to decribe data using vocabularies and ontologies. Ontologies are important as they give semantics to the data. Ontologies also give a structure to the data. 

Semantic interoperability is attained with ontologies. Technical interoperability, that is, exchanging pod data between two applications using common APIs and data formats,can be achieved through ontologies and querying for data in the Solid Pods. 

Applications who follow a similar ontology will have a similar structure and enables interoperability. Building applications using similar ontologies and comunica-sparql-solid[7] for querying the Solid Pods will make the applications truly interoperable. In addition, link-traveral[8] can be used for retrieving data from the Solid Pods and query them with comunica-sparql-solid.
